## Timed List
This class is designed to be a wrapper for arraylists that alows for elements to have an expiry time. After the expiry time the elements will no longer exist through the contains method.

## Todo

* Rather than using it as a wrapper, make it so that it actually implements the Collection interface
* Add thread safe version
